/* Task 1: No Parameters: Activate Hyperdrive */
// TODO: Write an arrow function named `activateHyperdrive` with no parameters that print `"Hyperdrive activated!"` to the console. Call `activateHyperdrive` to test it.
const activateHyperdrive = () => {
  return "Hyperdrive Activated";

/* Task 2: Implicit Return: Scan for Lifeforms */
// TODO: Create an arrow function named `scanForLife` that implicitly returns `"No lifeforms detected"` without using curly braces. Print the result of calling `scanForLife`.
const scanForLife = () => "No lifeforms detected";
scanForLife();

/* Task 3: Implicit Return with Objects: Log Coordinates */
// TODO: Write an arrow function named `currentCoordinates` that returns an object with properties `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing coordinates in space. Use implicit return. Print the returned object from `currentCoordinates`.
const currentCoordinates = (x, y, z) => ({ x, y, z });
currentCoordinates();

/* Task 4: Understanding `this`: Message from Home Base */
// TODO: Inside an object named `spacecraft`, create a method named `receiveMessage` using arrow function syntax. This method should log `"Message received: "` followed by a message it receives as a parameter. Directly call `receiveMessage` within `spacecraft` and observe. Observe and explain the behavior of `this` in this context as a comment.
const spacecraft = {
  message: "All clear",
  receiveMessage: () => {
    return `Message received: ${this.message}`;
  },
};

/*
 * Observations:
 * TODO: Explain here.
 * Arrow function doesn't use this the same as a standard function, arrow functions point to the window while standard functions point to the object they are in. This makes it so this can't really be used easily with an arrow function
